# Fall 2020 / Spring 2021

People on the academic job market in the USA (and probably many other places)

This list might not be complete, because I might not know who are the people on the market. Important: I include people in the list below only if they explicitly state on their web page that they are on the market in 2020/2021.

If you would like to be included, you can email me at academicjobmarket@gmail.com or you can submit a PR. You can include your name in multiple tables as appropriate. If your area is not listed below, let me know.
